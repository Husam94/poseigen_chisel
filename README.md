# Chisel 

This is a package for processing biological data to ML ready forms. It can process fasta, bed, bam, sam, bigwigs, bedgraphs, etc. 

Chisel tools are exemplified for modelling [YY1-DNA interactions](https://github.com/Husam94/YY1), specifically in processing genomic DNA sequences and histone and TF signals.
